Welcome to the code repository for my personal blog. It is the place where I share some of the projects and innovations I have worked on and wish to share.

You are, of course, free to check out the code. Everything is written by hand. Everything is subject to change, and since I regularly add new content, improve things, and optimize, you will probably find some weird or messy pieces of code. Also, note that I am a mechanical designer, so I learned to code by myself, so take a deep breath and enjoy the final result !
